I'm a full-stack engineer and creative technologist with over a decade of experience building software at the intersection of craft and human experience. My work spans interactive web platforms, real-time 3D systems, educational technology, and data infrastructure — with TypeScript, Vue.js, Angular, Unity, and a healthy pile of AWS services in regular rotation.

I care about the seams. The architecture that holds a system together, the pipeline that lets a designer work without touching code, the 30 ms between a user's action and the world responding. I've led multidisciplinary R&D teams at a STEM education company, shipped connected fitness features for a Pilates hardware startup, and contributed to large-scale display-management platforms used in stadiums and arenas worldwide.

Before all that I spent years making educational games — including a resource management sim about beehives and a neuroscience puzzle game that teaches how neurons fire. Some were NIH-funded; others emerged from 48-hour game jams. All of them taught me that good software, like good design, earns trust through how it behaves under pressure.

Outside of the day job I keep building. Athens, GA will do that to you.
